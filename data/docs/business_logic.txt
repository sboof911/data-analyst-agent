Business Logic for Bank Client Transactions

1. Transaction Types
	- Deposit: Money added to the account.
	- Withdrawal: Money taken out of the account.
	- Transfer: Money sent to another account.

2. Transaction Status
	- Completed: Transaction fully processed and balance updated.
	- Pending: Transaction initiated but not yet completed; does not affect balance.
	- Canceled: Transaction was canceled; does not affect balance.

3. Balance Logic
	- balance_after_transaction reflects the account balance after each transaction is applied.
	- Only transactions with transaction_status = Completed affect the balance.

4. Fees
	- fee_applied is subtracted from the account when applicable.
	- Fees do not appear in transaction_amount; they only affect balance_after_transaction.

5. Channels
	- ATM: Automated Teller Machine transactions.
	- Branch: Transactions conducted in-person at a bank branch.
	- Online: Mobile app or web banking transactions.

6. Derived Calculations / Examples
	- Spending by month: Sum of transaction_amount where transaction_type = Withdrawal, grouped by month.
	- Income by month: Sum of transaction_amount where transaction_type = Deposit, grouped by month.
	- Net change in balance: Last balance_after_transaction minus first balance_after_transaction for a period.

7. Agent Notes
	- All data is for a single client â€” queries do not need account IDs.
	- Only Completed transactions should be used in calculations.
	- The agent should consider transaction_datetime for trend analysis (daily, weekly, monthly).
